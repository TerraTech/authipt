REQUIRED SOFTWARE

This program requires ipset as a part of iptables/netfilter, and also the
python module called setproctitle.

On ubuntu, the required programs and modules can be installed (as root)
 apt-get install ipset xtables-addons-source
 module-assistant auto-install xtables-addons
 apt-get install python-setuptools
 easy_install setproctitle

INSTALLING

Add an authipt group.
 addgroup authipt
Create a directory to contain the 'records'. This will contain files describing
the IP addresses and usernamees of authenticated users, and you may want to
limit access to root.
 mkdir /var/authipt
 chmod 700 /var/authipt

Copy the authipt.py script to a system directory like /bin/, and set
appropriate permissions. It only needs to be read by root. We will use a
bash script called authipt to run the python script with sudo. This bash script
will only have to be run by users in the authipt group. Example script file
placed at /bin/authipt:
 #!/bin/bash
 /usr/bin/sudo -E /usr/bin/python /bin/authipt.py
 exit

 chown root:authipt /bin/authipt
 chmod 750 /bin/authipt			# only root and group can read/execute

To allow users in the authipt group to use sudo, edit the sudoers file. This
should be done with the "visudo" program. Adding the following line will let
users in the authipt group run the script as root, without a password prompt:
 %authipt ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: SETENV: /usr/bin/python /home/andreas/authipt/authipt.py

Users of authipt must be added to the authipt group.
 adduser myuser authipt
Set that users shell to /bin/authipt;
 chsh myuser

Now configure the important files:

IMPORTANT FILES

The following files are optional but useful.

/etc/authipt/motd
	Contains a message displayed to authenticated users.
/etc/authipt/users/USERNAME/motd
	A user-specific welcome message, overriding the default message.
/etc/authipt/users/USERNAME/banned
	If this file exists, the user USERNAME will be denied authentication
	and the file contents will be shown as a message to that user.

Both of the following files are required for user-specific iptables rules:

/etc/authipt/users/USERNAME/uprules
	The user-specific firewall rules to apply on successful authentication.
	Rules are written in the same format as iptables-save returns.
/etc/authipt/users/USERNAME/downrules
	User-specific firewall rules to apply when the auth session ends. Must
	remove all rules present in the uprules. Will not be applied unless
	uprules exist.

To see error or information messages from authipt, see /var/log/daemon.log.

In addition to the user-specific uprules/downrules files, the authenticated
users IP address will be added to an ipset named authipt. This lets you add
rules to iptables that apply to all authenticated users, by referring to the
ipset as a source or destination address. When an authenticated users session
ends, the users IP address is removed from the set. The following example rule
allows forwarding for all authenticated users;
 -A FORWARD -m set --match-set authipt src -j ACCEPT
See documentation for iptables on how to use ipsets.
