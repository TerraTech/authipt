This program requires ipset as a part of iptables/netfilter.

On ubuntu, the required programs and modules can be installed with;
 sudo apt-get install ipset xtables-addons-source
 sudo module-assistant auto-install xtables-addons

Add a authipt user and group.
Create a directory to contain the 'records' and set appropriate permissions;
 mkdir /var/authipt
 chown root:authipt /var/authipt
 chmod ug+sw /var/authipt

Compile the program with GCC and place in a useful spot with correct permissions;
 gcc authipt -o authipt
 chown root:authipt authipt
 cp authipt /bin/authipt
 chmod ug+s /bin/authipt
 chmod o-rwx /bin/authipt      -- blocks non-authipt users from access

Now create a group for all users that should have to authenticate;
 addgroup authipt
Add the users you want to have access;
 adduser myuser authipt
Set that users shell to /bin/authipt;
 chsh myuser


When you log in as myuser, you should see something like this;
 ipset v4.1: Set already exists
 Hello myuser. You are authenticated from host "192.168.2.201"

That means the users IP is in the IP set named authipt. That set is of type iphash.
If you for instance want to allow forwarding for that user, you could add an
iptables rule like
 -A FORWARD -m set --match-set authipt src -j ACCEPT
which will allow forwarding for all packets with a source of any IP address in the
set of authenticated users. When a user logs out, its IP address will be removed
from the IP set. If an existing session exists for an IP, or a user logs in twice,
the previous session for that IP is terminated and a new one is started.
